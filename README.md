## Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate into it:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/power-f-GOD/leads-UI.git && cd leads-ui
```

2. Install dependencies (Repo uses `pnpm` as package manager):

```zsh

```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project with the required environment variables. (See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section)

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables must be set in a `.env.local` file:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_PORT` (optional): The port that the API server is running
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MODE`: The mode in which the app is running: `'development'` | `'production'`

## Usage

pm dev
```

- `production` - Production mode (recommended for \[app\] preview)

```

`Sidebar:` You can set an alias for `pnpm` in your `.zshrc` (on Mac) or `.bashrc` file by including this line `alias pm=pnpm` therein.

2. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app running.
